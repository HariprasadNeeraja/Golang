# Depth First Search

It allows us to explore all the nodes and the edges of the graph.

Using this Algorithm won't provide much usefulness but it can be used as a building block
to perform other tasks like

1. Count the number of connected components
2. Determine Connectivity
3. Find the bridges or articulation points

## Time Complexity

> O(V+E) where, V is the vertices and E is the edges in the graph
